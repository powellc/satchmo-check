Satchmo Check Payment Module
=============================

A very simple module that captures an order, and sets it to new whilst not blanking the balance.

For the client this was developed for, checks worked almost like a reverse COD, more like delivery-on-check-arrival.

So we needed a way to set the order status to "New," list the order as successfully taken, but leave a balance which can be manually reduced to 0 once a check is 
recieved.
